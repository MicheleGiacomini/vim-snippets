# Readme
Fork of [honza/vim-snippets.]( https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets) with added LaTeX snippets. Includes single character snippets for all greek letters and abbreviations for various mathematical statements. 

The `math()` context is due to [Gilles Castel](https://castel.dev/), read his very nice [blog post](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) about livetyping LaTeX notes in vim.
